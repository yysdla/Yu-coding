# Findings: Hermes-only Migration

## 2026-09-18 Knowledge retrieval findings

- Stage 1 uses stable document IDs keyed by tenant, project, object kind, object ID, and revision. This preserves old source revisions instead of overwriting them.
- `SQLiteKnowledgeIndexStore` uses the existing namespaced migration API and keeps all reads explicitly tenant/project scoped.
- Adapters are deliberately authorization-neutral. They preserve source ACL/status metadata and mark records indexable or non-indexable; later retrieval services must still enforce authorization before scoring.
- Episode and MemoryObservation projections are marked historical; Obsidian Wiki projections are marked derived and remain lower-authority than Evidence/SourceRecord.
- Stage 2 reuses the existing dependency-free paragraph splitter but adds stable versioned chunk IDs and heading-path metadata. This keeps current indexers unchanged while making their output embeddable later.
- Chunk construction rejects pending, rejected, revoked, and expired records before they reach the vector index. Authorization is still a later query-time responsibility.
- Stage 3 uses a separate knowledge embedding cache keyed by chunk content/model/chunker versions. Provider failures are recorded through jobs and never remove lexical availability.
- Stage 4 vector scoring receives only `ContextEngine` candidates after `EvidenceAccessPolicy.filter()`. The application creates the vector retriever only when knowledge vector configuration is complete.
- Stage 5 adds source-layer semantics without flattening authority: Evidence/SourceRecord outrank approved memory, Wiki is derived, and Episode is historical. Existing tool-specific authorization remains the enforcement boundary.
- Stage 6 snapshots store only replay-critical references and metadata: object/result IDs, source layer, content hash, revision, Evidence IDs, validity, authorization result, retrieval mode, and policy/renderer versions.
- Detail replay re-reads current stores instead of trusting the original payload. Hash drift raises `CONTEXT_CHANGED`, revision drift raises `STALE_SOURCE`, and lost authorization raises `FORBIDDEN`.
- A combined legacy snapshot regression still has one pre-existing error-message expectation mismatch; the new knowledge snapshot tests are green and no legacy snapshot behavior was changed.
- Final stage 1-6 verification is green: 53 focused tests passed. Full repository regression remains 673 passed and 17 known pre-existing compatibility/environment failures.
- Manual vector activation is configuration-complete, but actual embedding availability depends on whether the configured OpenAI-compatible endpoint supports the selected embedding model. Provider errors are intentionally handled by lexical fallback.
- Stage 0 now has a standalone `RetrievalConfig` policy. It validates the public mode vocabulary, clamps operator limits, requires provider/model/version metadata before vector readiness, and falls back to lexical when vector prerequisites are incomplete.
- Knowledge retrieval settings are deliberately separate from the existing memory embedding settings so enabling semantic memory does not silently change Evidence retrieval.
- The config factory is side-effect free: it does not instantiate embedding clients or make network calls. External-call isolation remains enforced by the existing provider construction path.
- The initial baseline file records the dataset and metric schema but leaves metrics null; no retrieval quality claim is made yet.
- The executable baseline runner is now available as `python -m project_lens.evaluation.baseline`; its current demo replay reports Recall@8=1.0 and MRR=1.0 over 10 cases.
- The development set is still below the planned 30-50 cases and must be expanded before using it as a release gate.
- Stage 7 now has a deterministic evaluation platform: `RetrievalCase` validates JSON/JSONL cases, `retrieval_runner` replays lexical/vector/hybrid modes, `security_evaluator` blocks scope/status violations, and `release_report` records reproducibility metadata and gate decisions.
- The current development dataset is 10 cases. The generated report deliberately returns `insufficient_data`, even though the demo lexical and hybrid Recall@5 are both 1.0.
- Per-case reports do not persist full query text; they retain case IDs, retrieval trace, ranked source/object metadata, degraded reasons, and security-relevant fields.
- `ContextQuery.retrieval_mode` is an optional evaluation override. Existing callers continue using configured default mode, and vector failures still fall back to exact/BM25 when configured.
- Citation correctness/completeness and unsupported fact claims are deterministic checks. They do not replace semantic completeness, conflict handling, temporal reasoning, or human/LLM review.
- The local CLI supports a deterministic fake embedding provider for smoke tests and never contacts an external embedding endpoint unless a future live runner explicitly opts into one.
- Temporal evaluation is separated from general stale-result telemetry: a temporal case passes only when a relevant result is valid at `as_of` and is not stale, expired, revoked, pending, or rejected.
- Abstention and conflict metrics are answer-level measurements. They require answer replay records with `abstained` and `conflict_detected` flags; retrieval-only runs cannot manufacture these scores.
- Once the dataset reaches the release threshold, the gate requires explicit temporal, abstention, conflict, and fallback measurements instead of treating absent strata as perfect.
- The development replay now loads payment task/release fixtures. Its temporal case passes at `as_of=2026-07-21T00:00:00+00:00`; unrelated documents observed after that time remain a retrieval-quality signal, not a security leakage.
- The deterministic fake embedding provider produced hybrid Recall@5=0.875 versus lexical Recall@5=1.0 on the 12-case development fixture. This is a useful regression demonstration, not a real embedding quality measurement.
- Existing `ContextEngine.search()` uses `ExactCodeRetriever` plus `BM25Retriever` and `ReciprocalRankFusion`; it does not yet use embeddings for primary Evidence retrieval.
- `context/embeddings.py` already provides an OpenAI-compatible provider, SQLite cache keyed by project/object/model/content hash, and ProjectMemory/Episode scorers with safe failure behavior.
- `memory_retrieval.py` already performs lexical/semantic RRF, recency weighting, MMR, duplicate suppression, and conflict hints, but this logic is not shared with SourceRecord/Evidence/Wiki.
- `SQLiteMemoryStore.search_memories()` uses project-scoped FTS/BM25 candidate generation before authorized semantic scoring, which is the correct security pattern to generalize.
- `ContextEngine` filters Evidence before retrieval channels, so vector support must be inserted after `_access.filter()` and before fusion.
- `SourceRecord` preserves tenant/project/source/revision/content hash/access scope and is suitable as the provenance anchor for vectorized chunks.
- Obsidian Wiki is a derived, manifest-bounded reading layer and must remain a lower-authority retrieval channel than Evidence.
- The repository contains no `C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/qa_demo` checkout; the design therefore relies on the current ProjectLens contracts rather than copying an external retriever implementation.
- Full retrieval quality cannot be claimed until a versioned, role-aware golden set with at least 100 anonymized real questions exists.
- The implementation plan is intentionally staged: Evidence hybrid retrieval precedes Memory/Episode/Wiki unification, and evaluation gates precede production enablement.

## Source plan

- `docs/hermes-only-migration-plan.md` defines Hermes as the only production decision runtime.
- Required execution chain: trusted identity and scope -> Hermes runtime -> guarded tools -> AnswerDraft -> verifier -> ProjectAnswer/AudienceView.
- Legacy workflow and read-agent paths remain test/evaluation fixtures until their capabilities are migrated and regression coverage is established.

## Repository discoveries

- The worktree already contains extensive uncommitted Hermes, access-scope, answer-verification, Feishu, HTTP, MCP, and test changes. They must be preserved and treated as the working baseline.
- Newly present migration-relevant modules include `application/hermes_execution.py`, `agent/hermes_answer.py`, `agent/hermes_answer_parser.py`, `api/hermes_execution_routes.py`, and `integrations/feishu/hermes_context.py`.
- A broad text search returned no matches because the search expression was passed with incompatible PowerShell quoting. Inspect the known modules directly before judging gaps.
- `application/hermes_execution.py` is approval-gated patch execution, not the planned conversational Hermes runtime.
- `RunService.complete_external()` can persist a verified external answer, but its normal `execute()` path still branches between workflow and read-agent.
- `ProjectAgentAskService` currently rejects every RunService except `agent_mode="read_agent"`.
- `main.py` still creates a dedicated `ask_run_service` for read-agent and gates the Feishu bridge behind `feishu_use_hermes_tool_loop`.
- The bridge creates synthetic loop/trace IDs and produces an envelope itself, so its result needs to be normalized by the new shared runtime service.
- `AgentRun` currently stores only `runtime_access`; it lacks the Hermes runtime, entry mode, loop ID, context snapshot ID, and context hash required by the plan.
- Feishu currently calls the bridge first and only then calls `RunService.complete_external()`, which prevents tool lifecycle events from being associated with the real AgentRun.
- The Hermes loop runner already accepts a bounded context string and locks model execution to the `projectlens` toolset.
- `MessageAccessContext` provides the correct per-message trusted actor plus fresh scope binding for Feishu. HTTP already has a trusted `ActorContext` ingress dependency.
- `ProjectAgentRoleViewService` only needs a RunService-compatible read interface, so it can use the shared runtime service’s run service after ask migration.
- Focused Hermes regression: 10 tests passed. Two pre-existing runner-construction tests fail because pytest isolation intentionally blocks `assert_external_calls_allowed("hermes")` before their fake agent is constructed.
- `project_answer_to_envelope()` still stamps every response with `agent_mode="read_agent"`; it must derive runtime from the run record for Hermes-only responses.
- A strict `Literal["hermes"]` settings field caused legacy fixture construction to fail before pytest setup. Production is instead locked in `main.create_app()` while isolated fixtures retain explicit legacy RunService construction.
- The production source tree, `.env`, and `.env.example` no longer reference `feishu_use_hermes_tool_loop` or `ask_run_service`.
- The MCP stdio server currently has no verified transport-identity API. Its debug one-shot ask therefore fails closed unless an adapter supplies `ActorContext`; this is preferable to treating MCP tool parameters as authorization.
- The MCP stdio server can safely use an explicit injected actor resolver or deployment-owned MCP identity settings. Both formal tools and debug ask must ignore caller-supplied user/chat fields once a trusted actor is present.
- Feishu `DEBUG_PROJECT_COMMAND` and card `ask_question` still fell through to legacy `RunService.execute()`; Hermes preparation must be reusable so these callbacks can return a real run ID before background execution.

## Product direction: 2026-09-08

- The intended product is a cross-department project assistant in one real collaboration group, not a developer-only project Q&A bot.
- The first user value is shared project context: current scope, existing agreements, development arrangements, and test arrangements, with source-backed answers and explicit gaps.
- The trigger is mention-only (`@` or explicit question); proactive monitoring is out of scope for the first pilot.
- Knowledge should preserve immutable originals and maintain an LLM-derived Wiki organized by source type: requirements, Bitable data, meeting notes, development, testing, release, and project conventions.
- Authority is defined by fact type, version, effective time, and status. Meeting notes can propose changes but should not silently override formal requirement sources.
- GraphRAG is explicitly out of scope for this product. Use ProjectSpace, Evidence, ACL, RAG, structured metadata, source links, versions, statuses, and conflict/gap records instead.
- The pilot will use real read-only Feishu Docs, Feishu Bitable, stored meeting materials, and GitHub integrations, while keeping local fixtures for deterministic tests and historical replay.
- The development contract is now captured in `docs/projectlens-pilot-development-spec.md`; implementation should extend existing ProjectSpace, Evidence, ContextEngine, Hermes tools, and Feishu adapters instead of introducing parallel runtime or index stacks.

## Obsidian Vault Phase 0/1: 2026-09-12

- `docs/projectlens-obsidian-hermes-knowledge-base.md` defines Obsidian as a team reading, review, and proposal surface, while ProjectLens remains authoritative for Evidence, ACL, conflict resolution, and approval.
- `docs/projectlens-obsidian-hermes-development-plan.md` specifies that implementation begins with Vault contract freezing and a read-only export; Inbox imports, Hermes search tools, and Git automation follow in later phases.
- The repository already has reusable `SourceRecordStore`, `WikiDraftCompiler`, SQLite persistence, project registration, API patterns, and a Feishu-only `WikiPublisher` protocol. The Obsidian exporter should be a separate local publisher rather than adapting the Feishu publisher.
- Existing dirty worktree changes and the `obsidian-vault-seed/` example must be preserved. The seed is illustrative rather than an application-owned export target.
- `SourceRecordStore.all(tenant_id, project_id)` and `WikiDraftStore.list_for_project(tenant_id, project_id)` provide the ACL-filtered data boundary the later exporter can consume after the application service resolves access.
- `WikiPublisher` is a small structural interface, but the existing Feishu implementation makes network calls and has Feishu-specific identifiers. Obsidian must use an independent local publisher/service.
- `Settings` and FastAPI `application.state` follow central assembly in `main.py`; Phase 0 can remain isolated from that wiring except for additive settings fields.
## 2026-09-12 Phase 4

- Inbox proposals are accepted only from `40-inbox/human-proposals` and `40-inbox/hermes-proposals`.
- Required metadata is enforced: `proposal_id`, tenant/project scope, `kind`, `status=proposed`, `author`, `created_at`, `evidence_ids`, and `approval_required=true`.
- `approved_by`, `confirmed`, and `decided_by` are rejected in Inbox frontmatter. The authenticated caller, not the document author, becomes `KnowledgeProposal.created_by`.
- Imported proposals are persisted by `(source_path, source_hash)` and receive a review page under `50-review/pending-approval/`.
- Hermes proposal tools remain `allow_apply=false` and `requires_approval=true`; no `ProjectMemory` write path is called.
- Remaining focused-suite failures are pre-existing migration compatibility failures around rejected `query_graph` and legacy MCP catalog expectations.

## 2026-09-15 Phase 6

- Focused Obsidian/Git regression remains green: 43 passed.
- Full regression is not fully green: 629 passed and 13 failed.
- The 13 failures are outside the Phase 0-5 Obsidian/Git behavior: legacy Graph/MCP expectations, Hermes audience/card text expectations, a fixture that omits required `technical_summary`, and provider-default tests affected by the local `.env` selecting OpenAI.
- No Phase 0-5 failure was observed, and compilation plus `git diff --check` passed.
