## 2026-09-18 Knowledge retrieval implementation

| Stage | Status | Deliverable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0. Configuration and baseline | complete | Retrieval policy, safe defaults, ADR, baseline runner, focused tests. |
| 1. Knowledge index contract | complete | Stable document/chunk/embedding/job contracts, adapters, SQLite schema, and isolation tests. |
| 2. Chunk and provenance projection | complete | Stable chunk builder, heading/provenance metadata, overlap, and status filtering. |
| 3. Vector index and incremental jobs | complete | Validated embedding service, cache reuse, jobs, failures, and model-version isolation. |
| 4. Evidence hybrid retrieval | complete | ACL-first optional vector channel, trace fields, fallback, and application wiring. |
| 5. Unified source-layer retrieval | complete | Evidence/Memory/Wiki/History result facade with authority markers and state wiring. |
| 6. Detail, verifier, and snapshot replay | complete | Revalidate current details, verify Evidence-backed claims, persist/replay knowledge snapshots. |
| 7. Evaluation platform and quality gates | in_progress | Case schema, retrieval/security/citation/temporal/abstention/conflict/fallback evaluators, replay report, and insufficient-data gate. |
| 8. Shadow mode and production rollout | deferred | Requires a locked golden set and successful stage 7 release gate. |

## 2026-09-18 Stage 7 Stop Point

Stage 7's executable evaluation infrastructure is implemented, but the stage is
not release-complete because the repository only has a 10-case development set.
Stage 8 remains deferred.

Manual testing configuration is currently:

- `PROJECT_LENS_KNOWLEDGE_RETRIEVAL_MODE=hybrid`
- `PROJECT_LENS_KNOWLEDGE_VECTOR_ENABLED=true`
- shared OpenAI-compatible embedding credentials/model reused when dedicated
  embedding credentials are not supplied
- vector provider failure falls back to lexical retrieval

## 2026-09-16 Scope

Implement the first executable slices of `docs/projectlens-long-term-memory-development-spec.md` on top of the existing ProjectLens memory stack.

| Phase | Status | Deliverable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Contract and identity | complete | Lifecycle enums, source refs, trusted actor DTO, fact-key normalization. |
| 2. Storage and migration | complete | SQLite namespaced migrations, indexed columns, FTS metadata, transactions, replacement lifecycle APIs. |
| 3. Authorized retrieval | complete | Candidate/detail authorization and application retrieval service. |
| 4. Review primitives | complete | Idempotent in-memory review queue and service contracts. |
| 5. Production integration | complete | Hermes/tool/read routes, trusted Proposal/provenance paths, durable review triggers/APIs, and Context Snapshot freeze/replay. |
| 6. Evaluation and security gates | complete | Structured memory/security/temporal case sets, deterministic case validation, and production memory quality gates. |

# Hermes-only Migration Implementation

## Objective
Implement the Hermes-only production Agent runtime migration described in `docs/hermes-only-migration-plan.md`, preserving ProjectLens authorization, evidence verification, answer rendering, and audit boundaries.

## Phases

| Phase | Status | Deliverable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Baseline | complete | Mapped runtime composition, entry points, contracts, and tests. |
| 2. Runtime core | complete | Shared `HermesRuntimeService`, run audit fields, verified output, and fail-closed behavior. |
| 3. Entry migration | complete | HTTP, Feishu natural/debug/card asks, and MCP use the shared Hermes runtime with trusted actor binding. |
| 4. Configuration | complete | Production app is bound to Hermes; `ask_run_service` and request-level bridge flags are removed. |
| 5. Verification | complete | Hermes/MCP/Feishu/HTTP/RoleView/profile migration suite passes; syntax and diff checks pass. |

## Decisions

- Hermes makes Agent decisions; ProjectLens remains the authorization, evidence, verifier, and audit kernel.
- Production failures must fail closed rather than routing into legacy runtimes.
- Existing unrelated worktree changes are preserved.
- Use `ActorContext` and `EffectiveAccessScope` as the shared runtime contract; do not introduce caller-controlled authorization fields.
- Keep `Settings.agent_mode` permissive only for isolated legacy test factories; `main.create_app()` always constructs the production run service in Hermes mode.

## Errors

| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial planning skill path was incorrect. | 1 | Read the configured skill from `C:\Users\Administrator\.codex\skills`. |
| `python` was not available on PATH. | 1 | Use the configured local Python 3.12 executable for verification. |
| Sandbox denied the local Python executable. | 1 | Request permission to run the focused pytest suite with the configured executable. |
| Strict `Literal["hermes"]` rejected a developer `.env` before pytest initialization. | 1 | Updated `.env` to Hermes and kept the settings field fixture-compatible while `create_app()` remains Hermes-only. |

## Obsidian Vault Phase 0/1

### Objective

Implement the first two delivery milestones from `docs/projectlens-obsidian-hermes-development-plan.md`: freeze the secure Vault contract and export ACL-filtered ProjectLens sources and Wiki drafts as a read-only Obsidian Vault.

| Phase | Status | Deliverable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0. Vault contract | complete | Config, safe paths, frontmatter, manifest, and filesystem safety boundary. |
| 1. Read-only export | complete | Sources, Wiki drafts, review pages, navigation, API, and focused tests. |
| 2. Hermes Wiki read | complete | Manifest-bounded Wiki repository, search/read service, Hermes tool contracts, and focused tests. |
| 3. Knowledge operations | complete | Audited sync/export/lint operations, Lint findings, Hermes tools, and focused tests. |
| 4. Inbox proposals | complete | Controlled Inbox import and approval-bound proposal flow. |
| 5. Git/recovery operations | complete | Independent Vault Git workflow and recovery checks. |
| 6. Verification | complete | Focused regression tests, compilation, diff checks, and full-suite compatibility report. |

### Completed through Phase 5
